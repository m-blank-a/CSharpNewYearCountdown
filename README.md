# CSharpNewYearCountdown
This repository is dedicated to an annual
celebration of the 1^st^ day of January. I
dedicate myself to update this repository
on December of each succeeding years to
remind everyone of the joy of welcoming new
begginings to their own lives via pop songs.

This application notably uses:
* Uses a 96kHz, unsigned 32-bit .wav file
* Has a set time to play before New Year (*although you have to load this 15 minutes before New Year to ensure perfect timing due to the song buffering and the application relying on old Windows libraries*)
* Works only in Windows. No, I don't intend to add Linux, since I am not a Linux user who uses Linux for personal use.

## How to run?
Go to the `bin/Release` folder of this repository and
download the `.exe` file. Upon running it, this will
leave an icon on the system tray. (Often hidden in the
drop-down arrow near the battery icon)

Right-click to show an "Exit" button to stop the program
from playing music further.
